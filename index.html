            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp "My name is Meshane Peiris. I am a sophomore at Stony Brook University. I am currently dedicated to my pursuit of dual bachelor's degrees in computer science and applied mathematics. With over five years of experience as an educator at Royal Test Prep, I have had the privilege of teaching mathematics and computer science to students spanning grades three through twelve. This teaching experience has honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, equipping me with the ability to tackle complex challenges in both mathematical and computer science domains. My journey in computer science began with a strong curiosity to understand the digital world. Throughout my academic pursuits, I've developed a solid foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm enthusiastic about solving challenging problems and exploring the endless possibilities that technology offers. With a dedication to continuous learning, I look forward to applying my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative projects in the ever-evolving field of computer science. Beyond academics and coding, I'm deeply committed to community service. As a Litter Ambassador with NYC Parks, I actively contribute to environmental conservation by promoting cleanliness in public parks, especially during challenging times like the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. I firmly believe in the importance of giving back to our communities and aspire to leverage my technical skills to address real-world issues and make a meaningful difference."</p>

                    During my tenure as a NYC Parks Litter Ambassador from August 2019 to July 2021, I consistently demonstrated exemplary leadership by actively promoting cleanliness and environmental stewardship in the heavily polluted public parks of Queens, New York. My dedication to this role was particularly evident during the challenging period of the COVID-19 pandemic, when I willingly undertook strenuous outdoor tasks to maintain park hygiene and safety. Beyond these responsibilities, I also played a crucial educational role by instructing New York residents on the proper methods of waste disposal to prevent environmental contamination. My work as a Litter Ambassador underscored my commitment to environmental preservation and community engagement.</span>
